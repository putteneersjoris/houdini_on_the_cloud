check which debian version
$ lsb_release -a  

check cron status
$ systemctl status cron   

make an executable file
$ touch put_request.sh

inside that file, write your commands
curl -X PUT http://data.hasdata.xyz/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id": 31, "sensorID": 4, "type":4, "metric":4, "value":1, "time": "from curl-cron"}'  

make that file executable permissions
$ chmod u+x put_request.sh   	

open up all cron jobs in nano
$ crontab -e 
specify when cron should execute the shell script
# execute every minut
* * * * * /var/www/hasdata.xyz/put_request.sh  

this works, but not for houdini because of opengl and qt5








deploy houdini on the cloud

this test is done on gpy nvideo machine 90/month

rent a cloud server that has the minimum specs

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade

sudo apt install tasksel
sudo tasksel
install debian desktope env, gnome and laptop


and set no new password so you can log in to your nachine and comment out the second line  auth required pam_succeed_id.so user != root quiet acces   

nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password
sudo reboot

go to your machine and dont ssh into it, but view console

file> activate apprentice licesne
houdini now should be correcl;ty installed. you can open it in the terminal

to test it, make a houdini scene and render it with opengl. this should now work
install git
sudo apt install git
git clone the repository in documents https://github.com/putteneersjoris/houdini_on_the_cloud

change the base directory and houdini version (if changed) of the fil4es
and change the permissions of file exucute_py. otherwise cron will not run it

chmod 777 execute_py

make sure the setup run by running the execute_py script.

sh execute_py.sh

make a crontab that will render out an image every minute and make a log file so you can check for errors

sudo crontab -e
* * * * * export DISPLAY=:1 && /root/Documents/houdini_on_the_cloud/execute_py.sh > /root/Documents/houdini_on_the_cloud/houdini_log.txt 2>&1

make sure to specify the eisplay, otherwise opengl wiont work https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/68054/xdotool-using-display-0-not-works-in-crontab

install htop to see if the process is starting ort not
sudo apt install htop

if everythings goes well, you sjhould have a new image named output.jpg, open it up

xdg-open output.jpg 
and this file should change every minute

tip:dont do any of this using ssh because it wont work
